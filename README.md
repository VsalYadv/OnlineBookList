## Running the app

To get the app up and running (and really see if it worked), run:

```shell
npm start
```

This should start up your browser. If you're familiar, this is a standard
[react-scripts](https://create-react-app.dev/) application.

You can also open the production deployment:
[bookshelf.lol](https://bookshelf.lol).

## Running the tests

```shell
npm test
```

This will start [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) in watch mode. Read the output and
play around with it. The tests are there to help you reach the final version,
however _sometimes_ you can accomplish the task and the tests still fail if you
implement things differently than I do in my solution, so don't look to them as
a complete authority.

## Working through the exercises

To get started, run:

```shell
node go
```

This will allow you to choose which exercise you want to work on. From there,
open the `INSTRUCTIONS.md` file and follow the instructions.

If you'd like to work on an extra credit, but you want to skip the preceding
steps, you can run `node go` again:

```shell
node go
```

This will let you choose the next exercise or you can choose which part of the
exercise you'd like to work on. This will update your `exercise` files to the
correct version for you to work on that extra credit.

### Exercises

The exercises are in different branches. Each branch changes the
`INSTRUCTIONS.md` file to contain instructions you need to complete the
exercise.

The purpose of the exercise is **not** for you to work through all the material.
It's intended to get your brain thinking about the right questions to ask me as
_I_ walk through the material.
